I am a physicist and complex-systems researcher currently expanding my work into consciousness science.  
I completed my **B.Sc. in Astronomy & Astrophysics** at the University of Bologna, followed by an **M.Sc. in Gravitation and Astroparticle Physics (GRAPPA)** at the University of Amsterdam.  

I then transitioned into the **physics of complex systems** at Ben-Gurion University, where my Ph.D. focused on **pattern formation and eco-hydrological dynamics in semi-arid ecosystems**. Afterward, I worked on **spreading phenomena on networks** during a postdoctoral position at Tel Aviv University.

My current research moves between **environmental complex systems** and **contemplative neuroscience**. I am a postdoctoral fellow at the **Contemplative Neuroscience and Neurophenomenology Lab** at the University of Haifa, where I study **EEG time-series, predictive processing, and altered states of consciousness**. In parallel, I hold a postdoctoral position in **Yair Mau’s Eco-Hydrology Lab** at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

Across these fields, my interest remains constant: understanding how **complex systems—ecological, cognitive, and social—self-organize, adapt, and transform**.
