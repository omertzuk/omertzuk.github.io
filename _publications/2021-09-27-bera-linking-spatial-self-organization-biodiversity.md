Using a trait-based, spatio-temporal model of dryland plant communities, we analyse how self-organized vegetation patterns interact with climate-driven community reassembly. We show that pattern formation can reverse shifts from fast-growing to stress-tolerant species and counteract functional-diversity loss, while buffering the impact of further aridification on community structure. We also identify multistability between uniform and patterned states and discuss how it can inform non-uniform management strategies that balance ecosystem services and biodiversity.
