Focusing on dryland agroforestry, we investigate how spatial patterning of deep-rooted woody species and shallow herbaceous crops affects productivity, water-use efficiency, and resilience to drought. Using a two-soil-layer model, we compare stripe, gap, and hexagonal spot configurations and show that hexagonal woody patches can both increase system resilience and reduce crop suppression relative to conventional row planting. The results suggest new design principles for pattern-informed agroforestry layouts.
