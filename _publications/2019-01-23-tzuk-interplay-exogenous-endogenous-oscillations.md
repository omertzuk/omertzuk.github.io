Using a model of dryland vegetation subject to periodic rainfall, we ask whether observed vegetation oscillations are purely driven by environmental forcing or also shaped by endogenous dynamics. We show that, although self-sustained oscillations are absent in realistic parameter ranges, damped oscillatory modes can be resonantly excited by seasonal forcing. This resonance amplifies biomass oscillations, affects drought resilience, and can promote abrupt collapses, highlighting the importance of internal modes in interpreting seasonal ecosystem dynamics.
