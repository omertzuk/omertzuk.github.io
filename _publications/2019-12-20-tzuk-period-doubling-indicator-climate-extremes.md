Here we study dryland ecosystems subjected to strong seasonal variability and identify a temporal period-doubling route to chaos that precedes collapse to bare soil. Comparing fast-growing and stress-tolerant plant strategies, we find that period doubling emerges earlier and over wider ranges for fast growers, indicating higher vulnerability. We suggest that detecting period-doubling signatures in power spectra can serve as a robust early-warning indicator for climate extremes in vegetation and other ecological systems.
