This article examines wavelength selection in spatial patterns of dryland vegetation beyond the classical Turing instability regime. Using several ecosystem models, we explore how localized states, disturbances, and nonlinear dynamics shape the emergent pattern scale when many wavelengths are, in principle, possible. The study clarifies when linear predictions hold, when they fail, and how real ecosystems may settle on particular spatial scales under changing environmental conditions.
