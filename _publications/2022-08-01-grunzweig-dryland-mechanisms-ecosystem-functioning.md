This perspective reviews a set of “dryland mechanisms” that shape vegetation, water, energy, and biogeochemical fluxes in arid ecosystems. We argue that ongoing warming and drying will push historically wetter regions across thresholds where these mechanisms become increasingly relevant, potentially restructuring ecosystem functioning well beyond current dryland boundaries. We synthesize evidence for each mechanism and discuss implications for predicting and managing ecosystem responses to climate change.
