Here we examine why continuum partial differential equation (PDE) models are appropriate for modelling dryland plant populations, despite their discrete nature. Emphasizing plant traits such as phenotypic plasticity and stress-tolerant seed banks, we argue for biomass-density formulations and illustrate how PDE models reveal landscape-scale behaviours including pattern-forming instabilities, multistability, and front dynamics relevant to desertification. We also clarify what types of information can and cannot be expected from such models.
