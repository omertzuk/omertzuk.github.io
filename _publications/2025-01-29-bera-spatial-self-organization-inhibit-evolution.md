This work integrates adaptive dynamics with vegetation pattern-formation theory to ask whether spatial self-organization can slow or prevent evolutionary shifts toward low-productivity, stress-tolerant plant strategies under drying climates. We show that emerging vegetation patterns can maintain local water availability through patch thinning and dilution, thereby promoting an “evolutionary homeostasis” that preserves productivity and resilience over a broad precipitation range. The results highlight how spatial heterogeneity can modulate eco-evolutionary feedbacks in drylands.
