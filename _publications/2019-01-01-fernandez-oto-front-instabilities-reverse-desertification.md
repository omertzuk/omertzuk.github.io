In this paper we analyse dryland-vegetation models near desertification thresholds and focus on the dynamics of fronts separating vegetated and bare-soil states. We demonstrate that front instabilities can generate localized vegetation structures that propagate into the desertified region, effectively reversing desertification. The work highlights the importance of front dynamics and spatial patterning for understanding abrupt ecosystem transitions and possible recovery pathways.
