We document previously unknown fairy-circle vegetation gap patterns in remote Australian drylands and compare them to the well-known Namibian fairy circles. Combining fieldwork, remote sensing, spatial pattern analysis, and process-based modelling, we show that the Australian patterns share the same large-scale structure but are driven by a different biomass–water feedback. The results support a central universality principle of pattern-formation theory and suggest that self-organized gap patterns may be widespread in drylands.
